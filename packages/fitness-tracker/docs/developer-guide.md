# Developer Guide for Fitness Tracker MVP

## 1. Introduction

This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for developers working on the "Track Your Fitness Goals Easily Now" Minimum Viable Product (MVP) application. It outlines the application's architecture, key components, and development best practices.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The Fitness Tracker MVP follows a layered architecture, which helps to organize and maintain the application's functionality. The core layers are:

1. **Presentation Layer:**  This layer handles user interface interactions, routing, and data display. It's built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, offering a user-friendly web experience.
2. **Application Layer:**  This layer provides the business logic and API endpoints for managing user accounts, goals, and workouts. It leverages Express.js, TypeScript, and Prisma ORM for a robust backend.
3. **Domain Layer:** This layer defines the core business concepts and entities (e.g., User, Goal, Workout), their properties, and the business rules that govern their interactions. It adheres to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for a clean separation of concerns.
4. **Infrastructure Layer:** This layer provides the underlying infrastructure, including the database (MongoDB Atlas) and error tracking (Sentry).
