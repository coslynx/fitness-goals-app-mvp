# Architecture of "Track Your Fitness Goals Easily Now" MVP

This document outlines the architecture of the "Track Your Fitness Goals Easily Now" MVP application. It details the primary components, their interactions, and the overall design principles guiding the development.

**1. Layered Architecture:**

The MVP utilizes a layered architecture, separating concerns and promoting modularity. The primary layers are:

- **Presentation Layer:** This layer is responsible for the user interface (UI) and user interactions. It's built using Next.js with App Router for efficient routing and server-side rendering, React for building interactive components, and Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and customization. 

- **Application Layer:**  This layer houses the backend logic, including API endpoints, business rules, and data validation. It uses Express.js for building RESTful APIs, TypeScript for type safety, and Prisma ORM for simplified database interactions. 

- **Domain Layer:**  The domain layer defines the core business concepts and entities, such as `User`, `Goal`, and `Workout`. These entities represent the heart of the application's functionality and are responsible for managing their own data and behavior. This layer adheres to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, promoting a clean separation of concerns.

- **Infrastructure Layer:** This layer provides the underlying infrastructure, including:
    - **Database:**  MongoDB Atlas is chosen for its scalability and document-oriented structure, making it suitable for storing user data, goals, and workout logs.
    - **Error Tracking:** Sentry is used for real-time error monitoring and reporting, helping developers quickly identify and address potential issues.

**2. Key Components and their Interactions:**

The following diagram illustrates the major components and their interaction within the MVP's architecture:

end

**3. Key Architectural Patterns and Principles:**

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The Domain Layer emphasizes modeling the application's core domain concepts (goals, workouts, users) and their interactions. 

- **Use Cases:**  The Application Layer implements use cases for each critical action (e.g., create a goal, update a workout, delete a user). This pattern separates business logic from presentation, promoting testability and modularity.

- **Repositories:** Repositories act as an abstraction layer between the domain layer and the database. This allows for flexibility in choosing database technologies and ensures that the domain logic remains independent of specific database implementations.

- **Middleware:** The Application Layer uses middleware for authentication, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns. This pattern allows for centralized handling of these functionalities, promoting maintainability.

- **Component-Based Design:**  The Presentation Layer leverages component-based design, breaking the UI into reusable, self-contained components. This approach simplifies development and promotes code reusability.

**4. Data Flow and State Management:**

- **Data Flow:**  Data flows between the layers according to the following pattern:
    - User requests (e.g., creating a goal, logging a workout) originate from the Presentation Layer.
    - API calls are made through the Application Layer.
    - Business logic and validation occur in the Application Layer.
    - Data is persisted to the database through the domain layer and repositories.
    - Data is retrieved from the database for display in the Presentation Layer.

- **State Management:**
    - The Presentation Layer manages local state using Zustand, a lightweight state management library.
    - Shared state and global state access are handled through the `useStore` hook (or a similar mechanism) from the Presentation Layer, ensuring data consistency across components.

**5. Performance and Scalability:**

- **Performance:**  The MVP emphasizes performance optimization through:
    - Server-side rendering with Next.js to enhance initial page load times.
    - Code splitting with Next.js to deliver only necessary code to the user, improving page load speed.
    - Caching for frequently accessed data in the Presentation Layer and Application Layer.
    - Efficient database queries and indexing to minimize latency.

- **Scalability:**  The architecture is designed for scalability:
    - Cloud-based database service (MongoDB Atlas) allows for horizontal scaling.
    - Use of microservices or serverless functions (if necessary) can be integrated for specific tasks.
    - Modular code structure allows for easy expansion and addition of new features.

**6. Security and Data Protection:**

- **Input Validation:**  Thorough input validation is implemented throughout the codebase, particularly in controllers and use cases. This helps prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.

- **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data, such as user passwords, is hashed or encrypted securely using robust algorithms like bcrypt.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** NextAuth.js is used to handle user authentication through multiple providers (e.g., Google, Facebook). Secure JWT tokens are generated and validated for API calls and session management.  

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**  Appropriate CSRF protection mechanisms are implemented (e.g., using a middleware) to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable forms or actions.

**7. Extensibility and Future-Proofing:**

- The architecture is designed for extensibility by:
    - Using interfaces and abstract classes in the Domain Layer to define contracts for repositories and use cases.
    - Implementing the strategy pattern for swappable algorithms, allowing for flexible customization.
    - Utilizing dependency injection for better testability and ease of integration with external libraries.

- The MVP is future-proofed by:
    - Choosing well-maintained and popular technologies with a strong community (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Express.js).
    - Maintaining a modular and loosely coupled architecture, enabling easy modifications and additions of new features.

**8. Testing and Quality Assurance:**

- **Unit Tests:**  Comprehensive unit tests are written for all entities, use cases, services, and controllers, ensuring that individual components work as expected.
- **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests are implemented to verify that different layers and components work together seamlessly, including database interactions.
- **End-to-End Tests:**  End-to-End tests are executed to ensure the application's overall functionality from the user interface to the database.

**9. Documentation:**

- Clear documentation is provided for all code files, using inline comments and JSDoc-style comments to explain complex logic, design decisions, and potential issues.
- This architecture document outlines the overall design principles and major components of the MVP.

**10. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):**

- The project utilizes CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and efficient releases.

**11.  Monorepo Considerations:**

- The MVP is structured as a monorepo, with shared libraries and components utilized across different packages.
